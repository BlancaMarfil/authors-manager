# Authors Manager
This is a web application that helps you organise the books you've read focusing on the authors that have written them. Users can keep track of the books they've read, along with the dates they read them. The API (authors-manager-server) supports adding books to a user's catalogue, querying books read by a user, and checking if a book has been read by a user.
